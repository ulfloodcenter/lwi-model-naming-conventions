# LWI Model Naming Conventions: Stream naming algorithm

This software implements the [Louisiana Watershed Initiative (LWI)](https://www.watershed.la.gov) stream naming
algorithm, which is part of the LWI model data naming conventions. These conventions define the naming of physical
features (watersheds, streams) as well as hydrologic and hydraulic model elements to be incorporated in watershed
models developed under the auspices of the LWI. These naming conventions will be published as an appendix of the
[LWI Guidance on Modeling Methodology](https://www.watershed.la.gov).

Faithful application of these standards is critical to ensuring that LWI models are of high quality and are consistent
with each other, to the greatest extent practicable. Consistency between models enables interoperability of models
between geographies (e.g. coupled HUC8 watersheds) and across modeling frameworks (e.g. integrating HEC-RAS models
with ADCIRC in the coastal zone).

## Setup

### Pre-requisites
- Unix-like environment ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) should work)
- Python 3.7+
- GDAL 3+ (version 2+ may work as well)
- SQLite 3
- 7z
- wget

### Installation
```
git clone <PUT_URL_HERE>
cd <PUT_CLONED_DIR_HERE>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 setup.py install
```

### Download and prepare data
```
./bin/download-data.sh
```

> This could take one to two hours or more to complete, depending on your internet connection speed and the speed of
> your computer.

## Usage

### Label streams (using NHDPlus V2 data)
```
mkdir -p output
lwi-label-nhd-streams -f data/NHDFlowline_Network.spatialite -p data/NHD_PlusFlow.sqlite
```

By default, this will use the file `input/LWI_watersheds.csv` to control which HUC8 watersheds will have their
streams labeled, and also control the two-letter watershed code to be used for each HUC8. To use another watershed
definition file, use the `-w` option. Use the `--help` to see all options.

Also, by default, and in accordance with LWI Model Data Naming Conventions, stream level labels will be encoded
as [base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html). To use [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)
instead, add the `--hexadecimal` command line option.

Output will be stored in a directory named `output`.

### Combine output into one CSV file and add header
```
tail -q -n +2 *.csv > /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv
cat /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv | sort > /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv
head -n 1 AA_08080101.csv | cat - /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv > LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv
rm /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv
```

### Load CSV into your GIS and join to NHD Flowline layer
Use your favorite GIS to join the combined labeled streams in `LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv` generated above to your own
copy of the NHDFlowline vector layer. If you are using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), you should be able
to use `data/NHDFlowline_Network.spatialite` generated by `download-data.sh` as your NHDFlowline vector layer.

> Note: Use the `comid` field in `LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv` to join to the `comid` field in the NHDFlowline layer.

## Example data

Example output that has been joined to NHD Flowlines for HUC8s in the state of Louisiana can be found [here](https://services9.arcgis.com/SfvtKAxCn62UWpRg/arcgis/rest/services/LWI_LabeledNHDStreams_2021_03_29/FeatureServer).

## Appendix: setting up and using with NHDPlus HR data
NHDPlus HD currently (August 2021) seems to lack flow topology information in the NHDPlusFlow table needed to
successfully run the LWI naming algorithm. However, the instructions below are included as a starting point for
future use of NHDPlus HR.

### Extract HUC4-based data for all of Louisiana
```
ogr2ogr -skipfailures -f "SQLite" -dsco "SPATIALITE=YES" NHDPlusHR-LA.sqlite NHDPLUS_H_1114_HU4_GDB/NHDPLUS_H_1114_HU4_GDB.gdb NHDFlowline NHDPlusFlow NHDPlusFlowlineVAA && \

```

### Add indexes for fast searching
```
sqlite3 NHDPlusHR-LA.sqlite \
"create index if not exists nhdflowline_nhdplusid_idx on nhdflowline (nhdplusid); \
create index if not exists nhdplusflowlinevaa_nhdplusid_idx on nhdplusflowlinevaa (nhdplusid); \
create index if not exists nhdplusflow_fromnhdpid_idx on nhdplusflow(fromnhdpid); \
create index if not exists nhdplusflow_tonhdpid_idx on nhdplusflow(tonhdpid);"
```

### Usage
```
mkdir -p output
lwi-label-nhd-streams -f /path/to/NHDFlowline_Network.spatialite --nhdhr
```

> WARNING: NHDPlus HD seems to lack flow topology information in the NHDPlusFlow table needed to
> successfully run the LWI naming algorithm.

Note: To encode stream level labels as [base32](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html) instead of hexadecimal,
add the `--base32` command line option.

Output will be stored in a directory named `output`.

### Concatenate output into one file
```
tail -q -n +2 *.csv > /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv
cat /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv | sort > /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv
head -n 1 AA_08080101.csv | cat - /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv > LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv
rm /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels.csv /tmp/LA_HUC8_stream_labels-sorted.csv
```
